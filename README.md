# MarionetteJS + Brunch + Karma + Mocha + Chai

This is a [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test example for Brunch + MarionetteJS skeleton.

## Getting started

* Install:
    * Inside this folder run: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production
    * `npm test` — runs test for project
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
